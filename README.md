# Serverless-S3-Compliance-Scanner

## Project Description
This is a serverless S3 compliance scanner that audits encryption, public access, and versioning across all buckets and publishes versioned JSON reports to a secure S3 bucket. This project was
built based on a tutorial built with ChatGPT and Claude.ai.

## Components Description
| Component  | Functionality  |
|----------|----------|
| S3 Reports Bucket | The S3 bucket stores the JSON compliance reports generated by the Lambda scanner. |
| Lambda Function | The Lambda function runs the actual S3 compliance scanning logic. |
| AWS ECR | ECR acts as the secure container registry where your Lambda container image is stored. |
| CloudWatch | CloudWatch receives all logging output from the Lambda function. |
| Terraform | Terraform is used to automate and provision the entire cloud environment. |
| Docker | Docker packages the Python scanner application into a Lambda-compatible container image. |
