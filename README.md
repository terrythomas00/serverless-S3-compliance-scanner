# Serverless-S3-Compliance-Scanner

# Project Description
This is a serverless S3 compliance scanner that audits encryption, public access, and versioning across all buckets and publishes versioned JSON reports to a secure S3 bucket. This project was
built based on a tutorial built with ChatGPT and Claude.ai.
# Architecture

# Components Description
| Component  | Functionality  |
|----------|----------|
| S3 Reports Bucket | The S3 bucket stores the JSON compliance reports generated by the Lambda scanner. |
| Lambda Function | The Lambda function runs the actual S3 compliance scanning logic. |
| AWS ECR | ECR acts as the secure container registry where your Lambda container image is stored. |
| CloudWatch | CloudWatch receives all logging output from the Lambda function. |
| Terraform | Terraform is used to automate and provision the entire cloud environment. |
| Docker | Docker packages the Python scanner application into a Lambda-compatible container image. |
| Trivy | An open-source security scanner that identifies vulnerabilities in container images and other artifacts. |
# Prerequisites
* Install AWS cli
* Install VS Code
* Install Docker
* Install Trivy
* Install Colima (Only if using Mac OS)
## **Setting Permissions**
## Step 1: (**Testing Environment Only NOT Production**) Set these permissions for your Terraform user in AWS

| Terraform user | Environment  |
|----------|----------|
| **AdministratorAccess** | Test/Dev Only |
| **AmazonS3FullAccess** | Test/Dev Only |
| **AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess** | Test/Dev Only |

## Step 2: **Set your AWS cli credentials**
```bash
aws configure
```

# Deployment Guide
## 1. **Create The Reports Bucket**
```bash
terraform init
```
```bash
terraform apply -target=aws_s3_bucket.reports_bucket
```
## 2. **Create ECR Repository**
```bash
terraform apply -target=aws_ecr_repository.scanner
```
## 3. **Build your Docker Image**
- Note: Make sure you are in the root of the s3_compliance_scan folder before running the command below
```bash
docker build -t s3-scanner-lambda:lambda-arm64-fix2 -f app/Dockerfile .
```
## 4. **Scan your Docker Image for Vulnerabilities**
```bash
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL s3-scanner-lambda:lambda-arm64-fix2
```

**Security Notes**

- This project uses the official AWS Lambda Python base image.

- Trivy reports several HIGH vulnerabilities in AWS-managed components (e.g., libcap, Go stdlib, lambda emulator).

- These libraries are built into the base image and cannot be patched by the application.

- All project-level dependencies are fully updated.

- The image will be rebuilt automatically when AWS releases patched base images.
